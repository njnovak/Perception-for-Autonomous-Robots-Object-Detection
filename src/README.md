To run these files, matplotlib, opencv, and numpy are needed along with native python libraries.

Each file has been ran independently beforehand to confirm that it runs. Either run them from an IDE or type `$python3 Midterm_Q###.py` in terminal, where `###` is the question number.

I will comment out any unnecessary `cv2.waitKey`calls prior to submission. however, if intermediate images are desired for viewing while running, simply uncomment these `waitKey()` calls.

All results are saved as their own files and may be accessed within this folder as well. Question 2's results are labeled `ballDetected.mov`. Question 3 has the lines detected as `linesOnRails.jpg`, the warped image as `warpedRails.jpg`, and the final plot as `DistancePlot.jpg`. Question 4 has it's results set as `DetectedBalloons.jpg`.

Any inquiries or other miscellaneous issues may be emailed to nnovak@umd.edu.
