# Perception-for-Autonomous-Robots-Object-Detection
A few different dbject detection problems from my perception course's spring 2023 midterm.

This includes:
- Detecting a ball in a video using Hough Transforms
- Detecting train rails in an image and transforming the image to an overhead view
- Detecting, marking, and counting hot-air balloons in an image automatically
